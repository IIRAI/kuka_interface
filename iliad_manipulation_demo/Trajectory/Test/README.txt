This folder contains some script to test some communication capability between
ROS and MATLAB, such as services.

This script can be used for testing new hardware where the Reverse Priority/ 
Dual Manipualtion has been installed.

The main communication between the ROS software (Dual Manipulation) and the 
Matlab software (Reverse Priority) is achieved using "ROS services".
I hope that one day everything will work in a single environment, probably ROS,
so that this testing is useless.
